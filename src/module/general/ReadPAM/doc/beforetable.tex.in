% short description what the module does
%

ReadPAM reads DSY and THP files. From the DSY file it
may read the grid, nodal and cell data. Global data may be read
from either the DSY file or the THP. Before you try using this
module and the examples below you have to set the
PAMHOME environment variable. A line setting this variable
may be already present in your .covise file. In this case
you may have to correct the value for this variable to
the path of the directory for your DSY
library installation directory.
Your license file, without which this module will not work,
is found in the subdirectory {\it licenses}
under this directory.

The module inspects the input file and produces lists
for the available variables that you may select for output.
The number of cell or global variables may be sometimes very long.
There should be no problem with that in principle, but in
extreme cases, some important time delays may appear. 
Then you may limit the number of the different categories of variables
by creating a {\sl ReadPAM\_Limits} section in your covise.config
file. In this section you may define the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item
CellVarLimit limits the maximum number of cell variables.
\item
GlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of global variables.
\item
MatGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of material global variables.
\item
TsGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of transmission section global variables.
\item
CiGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of contact interface global variables.
\item
RwGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of rigid wall global variables.
\item
AbGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of airbag global variables.
\item
AbChGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of airbag chamber global variables.
\item
AbWGlobalVarLimit limits the maximum number of airbag wall global variables.
\end{itemize}

We strongly recommend not to use this section in your covise.config unless
it is extremely necessary. If you create this section thereby establishing
some limits, and create a map with them, in the future you will have to use
the same limits in order to run successfully that net file, otherwise
ReadPAM will probably crash.

An additional remark about long choice lists is in order. You may have difficulties
when trying to access some variable if the choice list is too long
for the dimensions of your screen. That is not a real problem, you may
also change the appearance of the parameter to a combo box.

ReadPAM is available for COVISE version 5.1 and higher.
It has been tested on SGI systems (IRIX 6.5).

{\bf SGI only, PAM license required - no LINUX support}
