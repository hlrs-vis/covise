Please follow the following guidelines.


Source Code Formatting
======================

* UNIX line-feeds
* no tabs
* avoid trailing spaces
* files have to end with a new-line
* only ASCII characters (no latin1 or unicode - their behaviour depends on character sets)
* opening and closing braces on their own line
* indent by 4 spaces

You can use 'scripts/indent.sh' (needs clang-format and dos2unix) for re-indenting the source code.
If changing source code formatting, then do that as a separate commit:
this makes it easy to follow the actual code changes.


Source Code Management
======================

This will make your commits easy to follow by others:
* descriptive commit logs (in the context of the changed files)
  - summarise what was changed for large commits
  - when making small changes, don't repeat what was changed but, but state
    the reason for the change
* only one change/bug fix/feature per commit
* try to commit all files belonging to one change together in a single commit
* separate changed source code formatting from actual code changes into
  different commits
* aim for committing only compiling source code and after committing test on other
  platforms, too (Linux/Windows)


Coding Style
============

* protect your headers with include guards like this:
  #ifndef MY_PRETTY_HEADER_H
  #define MY_PRETTY_HEADER_H
  ...
  #endif
* #include all necessary headers at the beginning of the file
* in order to reduce compile times (and recompilation) you should avoid
  including headers from headers, instead use forward declarations whenever possible:
  class MyPrettyClass;
* also in order to reduce compile times (and recompilation) you should try to restrict
  headers to declarations and avoid code within headers
* don't use "using namespace <my_namespace>" or "using ..." in global scope in header files
* include parameter names in functions prototypes in headers - these serve as
  documentation
* think about variable names, don't name them just 'tmp'
* documenting code helps understand it, therefore documenting code is a real benefit
* initialize variables as soon as you define them, e.g:
  int i = 0;
  instead of
  int i;
* make the scope of variables as small as possible - this makes it easy to see
  until which point the value of a variable has relevance
  - define another variable, perhaps even with identical name, if necessary for another
  independent purpose - the compiler will reuse space if possible,
  e.g.:
  if(something)
  {
     bool important_flag = false;
     // use important_flag
  }
  else
  {
     bool important_flag = false;
     // use important_flag
  }

  instead of:
  bool important_flag = false;
  if(something)
  {
     // use important_flag
  }
  else
  {
     // use important_flag for a different purpose
  }
